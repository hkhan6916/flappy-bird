# Flappy bird

Created a fun web version of flappy bird over a year ago as a fun game. Used some help from a library called s5 and some tutorials on it. This was for the collision detection of the bird hitting a pipe and ending the game.

## Getting Started

Set configurations in bird.js.
Default configurations are:
```
this.width = 50;
this.height = 50;
this.x = width / 2;
this.y = height / 2;
this.gravity = 0.5;
this.lift = 17;
this.velocity = 0;
```
## Running the code

Run:
```
index.html
```

This will ask to open up a browser of your choice. After choosing a browser, the game will start.
